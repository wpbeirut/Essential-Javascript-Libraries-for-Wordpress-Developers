# Essential-Javascript-Libraries-for-Wordpress-Developers
You can add great functionality to a website by using JavaScript, but sometimes writing the necessary code can be time-consuming, especially for more complex tasks.  we will add plugins libraries for vanilla JavaScript that will take the guesswork out of complex tasks like creating progress bars, formatting inputs, lazy loading images, and more.

# Progressbar.js
you can find samples on progressbar.js folder in this repository.
files include 2 examples:
